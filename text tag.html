<p>
      When despair for the world <em>grows</em> in me
      and <br/>
      I wake in the night at the least sound
      in fear <br/>
      of <strong>what my <em>life and my childrenâ€™s</em>  lives</strong>  may be,<br/>
      I go and lie down where the wood drake <em>rests</em> <br/>
      in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.<br/>
      <strong>I come into the <em>peace</em> of wild things</strong> <br/>
      who do not tax their lives with fore thought
      of grief.<br/>
      I come into the <em>presence</em> of still water.<br/>
      And I feel above me the <em>day-blind</em>  stars<br/>
      waiting with their light. For a time<br/>
      <strong>I rest in the grace of the world, and am free</strong>. <br/>
